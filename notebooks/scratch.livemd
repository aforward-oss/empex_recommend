## Tensors

The tensor [arg](https://hexdocs.pm/nx/Nx.html#tensor/2) can be one of many things

* A number (aka scalar)
* A boolean (synatic sugar on a special 0/1 tensor)
* A list of numbers, booleans, or list of numbers and booleans
* A tensor (why? well the `opts` we haven't talke about yet would then be used to tweak an existing tensor)

```elixir
```
